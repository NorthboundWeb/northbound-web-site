/**
 * Minimal fixed-window rate limiter held in module memory.
 *
 * Deliberately simple: this site has one public write path (the enquiry form),
 * so a shared store would be infrastructure bought for a problem that does not
 * exist yet.
 *
 * Known limitation: serverless instances do not share memory, so the effective
 * limit is per warm instance rather than global. It raises the cost of casual
 * form spam; it is not a defence against a determined distributed flood. If
 * this site ever grows a login or a payment path, replace it with a shared
 * store (Upstash, or a Postgres table) rather than extending this.
